This is comprehensive.  I expect Claude Code to indientify whats needed for a core shipment that we can build out from, from there.  Include poossibiolity of integration to gingr in first shipment if it's easy enough to get done in a week on the $100/month claude max subscription.

## Customer Loyalty App — Full Feature List Discussed

### 1) Customer Experience (Front-End)

* **Mobile-friendly web app** (works in Safari/Chrome — no App Store download required initially)
* **Customer sign-up / enrollment flow**
* **Customer dashboard** showing:

  * Current loyalty points balance
  * Available reward options
  * Redemption progress (ex: “100 points = $10 off grooming”)
* **Reward redemption options** (simple, pre-set choices)

  * Example tiers discussed:

    * 100 points → $10 grooming discount
    * 250 points → $25 grooming discount
    * 500 points → $50 grooming discount
* **Customer referral code** displayed after redemption (or as part of account)
* Future option: **QR-based referral code** (instead of typing/sharing a code)

---

### 2) Points System (How Points Are Earned)

* **Points tied directly to dollars spent**

  * Example: $47 daycare = 47 points
* Points earned from multiple service types (implied):

  * Daycare
  * Boarding / hotel
  * Grooming
* Ability to award points for **user-generated content (UGC)**

  * Example: customer posts a Reel + tags Happy Tail → award points (suggested ~50 points)
* Points earned from **referrals**

  * Referral tracking tied to the customer’s code / QR

---

### 3) Rewards / Redemption System

* Rewards are **restricted + customizable**

  * Discussed using rewards to **push grooming growth** specifically
* Redemption produces a **trackable confirmation** on the system side
* Admin processes redemption and points are deducted
* Customer can “save up” points to redeem larger rewards (example: choose $25 off instead of $10)

---

### 4) Admin Portal (Business Side)

* Admin login / backend view
* Ability to:

  * **View all customers**
  * **Search customers**
  * **Manually add points** to a customer account
  * **Process reward redemptions**
* Admin workflow options:

  * Add points **at checkout**
  * OR add points **in a daily batch** at end of day

---

### 5) Gingr Integration (Near-Term + Long-Term Options)

**MVP approach discussed (no full integration yet):**

* Export a **daily checkout report** from Gingr (Excel file)
* Upload that file into the loyalty system
* System automatically:

  * Applies points to customers who are enrolled
  * Ignores / rejects customers not enrolled
  * (Suggested enhancement) shows a summary like:

    * “Points applied successfully: X”
    * “Points rejected (no account found): Y”

**Future integration option discussed:**

* Deeper integration with Gingr (paid + more complex)
* Goal: remove manual uploads and automate points assignment

**Long-term vision:**

* Potential to **replace Gingr entirely** with a custom system

---

### 6) Referral Program Features

* Referral codes assigned per customer
* Referral tracking intended to be:

  * Automatic
  * Not dependent on staff memory
* Future: **QR referral code** for easy sharing
* Apartment complex referral partner use case:

  * Leasing office / manager shares referral QR
  * Scans track back to them automatically
  * Rewards accumulate in their account

---

### 7) Marketing + Growth Features Connected to Loyalty

* Loyalty system used to incentivize:

  * Reviews (QR code for Google review mentioned separately, but loyalty can support it)
  * Referrals
  * Social tagging + UGC
* Ability to “steer” rewards toward grooming

  * Keep points redemption grooming-focused to drive bookings + content

---

### 8) Rollout / Testing Plan (Operational Feature)

* Start with a **pilot group of 10–15 trusted customers**
* Test the full loop:

  * Sign up
  * Earn points
  * Redeem points
  * Track referrals
* Validate it works in real checkout conditions without creating staff burden

---

### 9) Hosting / Infrastructure Plan

* Current state: running on **Johnny’s laptop** (prototype)
* Next step: run on a **dedicated home server** for short-term testing
* Long-term: move to a proper hosting environment (cloud deployment) for reliability

  * Reason: uptime + stability (can’t depend on home internet forever)

---

### 10) Future “Full App Ecosystem” Vision (Discussed)

If expanded beyond loyalty, the long-term vision included:

* Full booking + account management replacing Gingr
* Loyalty built in natively
* Centralized customer experience on mobile
* Ability to send **photos directly to customers through the app**
* Messaging/communications improvements
* AI layer that’s “in the middle” (not in-your-face)

  * AI receptionist concept
  * AI aware of capacity, schedules, policies, etc.

---

### 11) AI + Automation Concepts Mentioned (Adjacent but Related)

* Record all customer calls (“quality assurance”) to build training data
* Future AI assistant/receptionist trained on:

  * how Ted/Julian answer questions
  * real customer conversations
* Reduce admin workload over time while keeping the “family business” vibe intact

If you want, I can also convert this into a **clean “MVP Requirements” list** (what gets built first vs later), or a **one-page spec** you can drop into your AI Design workflow.
