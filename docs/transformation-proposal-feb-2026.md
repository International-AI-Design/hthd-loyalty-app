## Options Going Forward

### Option 1: Buy the Loyalty App Outright

**One-time: $2,500**

What you get:
- The app as-is, fully functional
- Handoff documentation
- 30 days of transition support
- You own it completely

What happens next:
- You manage hosting ($0-20/mo on free tiers)
- You handle any future changes
- No ongoing relationship with me

**Best for:** If you want complete independence and have someone technical to handle maintenance.

### Option 2: Intro Bundle (Monthly)

**Bundled: $150/mo** (saves $75/mo vs individual pricing)

Individual pricing:
| Service | Price |
|---------|-------|
| Website management | $75/mo |
| Google Business Profile | $50/mo |
| Loyalty app maintenance | $100/mo |

What's included:
- Website updates (reasonable volume)
- Google Business Profile optimization and posting
- Loyalty app maintenance, bug fixes, Gingr sync monitoring
- Quarterly feature updates to the app
- Email support

**Best for:** Getting digital management off your plate at a fair price.

Everything in the Intro Bundle, PLUS:
- Google Workspace administration

## The Simple Pitch

You're currently paying ~$350/mo for Gingr, website help, and Workspace. For about the same money, you get:

1. All of that managed by one person who knows your business
2. A loyalty app driving repeat business
3. A path to replace Gingr with something built for you
4. Ted's nights and weekends back

---

## De-Risk Elements

We want this to work for both of us:

- **Month-to-month** after any initial commitment
- **Cancel with 30-day notice** - no long-term lock-in
- **You own all your data** - always exportable
- **Can take the app and go** anytime (Option 1 always available)
- **Clear deliverables** - you know exactly what you're getting

---

## Commitment Levels

| Option | Upfront | Monthly | Commitment |
|--------|---------|---------|------------|
| Buy App Outright | $2,500 | $0 | One-time |
| Intro Bundle | $0 | $150 | Month-to-month |
| Full Digital Takeover | $1,000 | $250 | 3-month minimum, then month-to-month |

---

## Next Steps

1. **Today:** Questions, discussion, think about what fits
2. **This week:** Let me know which direction you're leaning
3. **If moving forward:** We'll document the details and get started

No pressure. The app is live and working regardless of what you decide. I'd love to keep building with you, but the choice is yours.
