PHASE 1: 60-DAY GROOMING GROWTH PACKAGE


Proposal for Happy Tail Happy Dog
Prepared by: Ferro Consulting LLC
Date: October 16, 2025


THE VISION: Building Your Business for Financial Freedom
You didn't build Happy Tail Happy Dog to work yourselves to death. You built it to create financial freedom and the life you want - mountains, travel, retirement on your terms.
Right now, the business only works when you're both running at 100mph. That groomer sitting idle at 25% capacity? That's $30-40K bleeding away every year. More importantly, it's proof that you don't have bandwidth to scale.
This proposal is Phase 1 of a three-phase journey:
Phase 1: PROVE - Fix grooming, generate $80-100K additional annual revenue, prove the model works
Phase 2: SYSTEMATIZE - Free up Ted's time, empower your team, build systems so the business runs without you
Phase 3: SCALE - Position for expansion, franchise, sale, or owner-to-oversight transition - your exit strategy

WHY START WITH GROOMING?
1. Most urgent pain - Bleeding money right now
2. Fastest results - See bookings within 2 weeks
3. Builds trust - Proves the transformation is possible
4. Funds Phase 2 & 3 - Extra revenue pays for next phases


THE 3-5 YEAR VISION
Year 1: Grooming profitable, operations systematized, Ted has his time back
Year 2: Business runs with minimal owner involvement, consistent profitability, documented systems
Year 3-5: Your choice - Second location open, franchise launched, business sold for 3-5x revenue, or you're working 20 hours/week while it runs itself
This is how you build a business worth retiring on.


THE BIGGER PICTURE
This isn't just about grooming bookings. This is about building a business that creates the financial freedom you're working toward.
A business you can expand, franchise, sell, or step away from while it runs itself.
A business that works FOR you, not the other way around.
Grooming is where we start. But the real work is building your exit strategy.
